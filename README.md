EXPLAIN VERSION CONTROL

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control tracks the progress of code across development and iterations and also aids in managing changes during the lifecycle.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB

Git is a distributed sort of version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. While, Github is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, and manage their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration for every project.
